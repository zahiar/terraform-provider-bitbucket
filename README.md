# Terraform Provider: Bitbucket Cloud
This is a Terraform provider for managing resources within a Bitbucket Cloud account.

## Getting Started
As this provider is published to the public [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/zahiar/bitbucket),
you can install it like so (for Terraform 0.14+):
```hcl
provider "bitbucket" {
  username = "myUsername"
  password = "myPassword"
}

terraform {
  required_providers {
    bitbucket = {
      source  = "zahiar/bitbucket"
    }
  }
}
```

For more detailed instructions and documentation on the resources and data sources supported, please go to
[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/zahiar/bitbucket/latest/docs).

## Maintenance
This provider is maintained during free time, so if you are interested in helping to develop this further, you
are more than welcome to submit a pull request or raise a ticket if you'd prefer.

## Development

### Requirements
If you do wish to help develop this, you will need the following installed:
* [Go](http://www.golang.org) (see `go.mod` file for the correct version to install)
* [Go Linter](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/golangci-lint)
* [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) (is correctly setup)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (0.14+)

### Building
Simply run `make build`, and it will compile and create a binary, as well as print-out instructions
on how to configure Terraform to use this locally built provider.
```shell
$ make build
```

### Testing

#### Unit Tests 
```shell
$ make test
```

### Acceptance Tests
This will require you to specify two environment variables (`BITBUCKET_USERNAME` & `BITBUCKET_PASSWORD`), as these tests
will provision actual resources in your account, and it will tear them down afterwards to ensure it leaves your account clean.

**NOTE**: if a test fails, it may leave dangling resources in your account so please bear this in mind.

If you have two-factor authentication enabled, then be sure to set up an [app password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/) and use that instead.
```shell
$ BITBUCKET_USERNAME=myUsername BITBUCKET_PASSWORD=myPassword make testacc
```

### Documentation
Every data source or resource added must have an accompanying docs page (see `docs` directory for examples).

Docs are written using Markdown, and you can use [this page](https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview) to preview what your docs will look like when rendered.
